# SmartSearch-FSBI
SmartSearch-FSBI introduces Fractal Semantic Bloom Indexing (FSBI), which uses fractal query decomposition with hierarchical Bloom filters enriched by semantic embeddings, enabling efficient substring, fuzzy, and semantic-aware search with privacy, reduced storage, and low network overhead.
